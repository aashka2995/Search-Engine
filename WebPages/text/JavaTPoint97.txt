JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. There are four types of JDBC drivers: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver, Native Driver, Network Protocol Driver, and Thin Driver We have discussed the above four drivers in the next chapter. We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational database. By the help of JDBC API, we can save, update, delete and fetch data from the database. It is like Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) provided by Microsoft. The current version of JDBC is 4.3. It is the stable release since 21st September, 2017. It is based on the X/Open SQL Call Level Interface. The java.sql package contains classes and interfaces for JDBC API. A list of popular interfaces of JDBC API are given below: Driver interface Connection interface Statement interface PreparedStatement interface CallableStatement interface ResultSet interface ResultSetMetaData interface DatabaseMetaData interface RowSet interface A list of popular classes of JDBC API are given below: DriverManager class Blob class Clob class Types class Why Should We Use JDBC Before JDBC, ODBC API was the database API to connect and execute the query with the database. But, ODBC API uses ODBC driver which is written in C language (i.e. platform dependent and unsecured). That is why Java has defined its own API (JDBC API) that uses JDBC drivers (written in Java language). We can use JDBC API to handle database using Java program and can perform the following activities: Connect to the database Execute queries and update statements to the database Retrieve the result received from the database. Do You Know How to connect Java application with Oracle and Mysql database using JDBC? What is the difference between Statement and PreparedStatement interface? How to print total numbers of tables and views of a database using JDBC? How to store and retrieve images from Oracle database using JDBC? How to store and retrieve files from Oracle database using JDBC? What is API API (Application programming interface) is a document that contains a description of all the features of a product or software. It represents classes and interfaces that software programs can follow to communicate with each other. An API can be created for applications, libraries, operating systems, etc. Topics in Java JDBC Tutorial 2) JDBC Drivers In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn four types of JDBC drivers, their advantages and disadvantages. 3) 5 Steps to connect to the Database In this JDBC tutorial, we will see the five steps to connect to the database in Java using JDBC. 4) Connectivity with Oracle using JDBC In this JDBC tutorial, we will connect a simple Java program with the Oracle database. 5) Connectivity with MySQL using JDBC In this JDBC tutorial, we will connect a simple Java program with the MySQL database. 6) Connectivity with Access without DSN Let's connect java application with access database with and without DSN. 7) DriverManager class In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn what does the DriverManager class and what are its methods. 8) Connection interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn what is Connection interface and what are its methods. 9) Statement interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn what is Statement interface and what are its methods. 10) ResultSet interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn what is ResultSet interface and what are its methods. Moreover, we will learn how we can make the ResultSet scrollable. 11) PreparedStatement Interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn what is benefit of PreparedStatement over Statement interface. We will see examples to insert, update or delete records using the PreparedStatement interface. 12) ResultSetMetaData interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn how we can get the metadata of a table. 13) DatabaseMetaData interface In this JDBC tutorial, we will learn how we can get the metadata of a database. 14) Storing image in Oracle Let's learn how to store image in the Oracle database using JDBC. 15) Retrieving image from Oracle Let's see the simple example to retrieve image from the Oracle database using JDBC. 16) Storing file in Oracle Let's see the simple example to store file in the Oracle database using JDBC. 17) Retrieving file from Oracle Let's see the simple example to retrieve file from the Oracle database using JDBC. 18) CallableStatement Let's see the code to call stored procedures and functions using CallableStatement. 19) Transaction Management using JDBC Let's see the simple example to use transaction management using JDBC. 20) Batch Statement using JDBC Let's see the code to execute batch of queries. 21) JDBC RowSet Let's see the working of new JDBC RowSet interface.
