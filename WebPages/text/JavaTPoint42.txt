If the number of iteration is not fixed and you must have to execute the loop at least once, it is recommended to use do-while loop. The Java do-while loop is executed at least once because condition is checked after loop body. Syntax: 
do{
//code to be executed
}while(condition);
 Example: 
public class DoWhileExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i=1;
    do{
    	System.out.println(i);
    i++;
    }while(i<=10);
}
