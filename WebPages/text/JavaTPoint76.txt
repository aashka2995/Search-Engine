If we call a method passing a value, it is known as call by value. The changes being done in the called method, is not affected in the calling method. Example of call by value in java In case of call by value original value is not changed. Let's take a simple example: 
class Operation{
 int data=50;

 void change(int data){
 data=data+100;//changes will be in the local variable only
 }
   
 public static void main(String args[]){
   Operation op=new Operation();

   System.out.println("before change "+op.data);
   op.change(500);
   System.out.println("after change "+op.data);

 }
}
 download this example 
Output:before change 50
       after change 50				
 Another Example of call by value in java In case of call by reference original value is changed if we made changes in the called method. If we pass object in place of any primitive value, original value will be changed. In this example we are passing object as a value. Let's take a simple example: 

class Operation2{
 int data=50;

 void change(Operation2 op){
 op.data=op.data+100;//changes will be in the instance variable
 }
   
  
 public static void main(String args[]){
   Operation2 op=new Operation2();

   System.out.println("before change "+op.data);
   op.change(op);//passing object
   System.out.println("after change "+op.data);

 }
}
 download this example 
Output:before change 50
       after change 150
