Java socket programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices. Advantage of Java Networking sharing resources centralize software management Do You Know ? How to perform connection-oriented Socket Programming in networking ? How to display the data of any online web page ? How to get the IP address of any host name e.g. www.google.com ? How to perform connection-less socket programming in networking ? Java Networking Terminology The widely used java networking terminologies are given below: IP Address Protocol Port Number MAC Address Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol Socket 1) IP Address IP address is a unique number assigned to a node of a network e.g. 192.168.0.1 . It is composed of octets that range from 0 to 255. It is a logical address that can be changed. 2) Protocol A protocol is a set of rules basically that is followed for communication. For example: TCP FTP Telnet SMTP POP etc. 3) Port Number The port number is used to uniquely identify different applications. It acts as a communication endpoint between applications. The port number is associated with the IP address for communication between two applications. 4) MAC Address MAC (Media Access Control) Address is a unique identifier of NIC (Network Interface Controller). A network node can have multiple NIC but each with unique MAC. 5) Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol In connection-oriented protocol, acknowledgement is sent by the receiver. So it is reliable but slow. The example of connection-oriented protocol is TCP. But, in connection-less protocol, acknowledgement is not sent by the receiver. So it is not reliable but fast. The example of connection-less protocol is UDP. 6) Socket A socket is an endpoint between two way communication.
