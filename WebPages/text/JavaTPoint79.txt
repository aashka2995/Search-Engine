The arguments passed from the console can be received in the java program and it can be used as an input. So, it provides a convenient way to check the behavior of the program for the different values. You can pass N (1,2,3 and so on) numbers of arguments from the command prompt. Simple example of command-line argument in java In this example, we are receiving only one argument and printing it. To run this java program, you must pass at least one argument from the command prompt. 
class CommandLineExample{
public static void main(String args[]){
System.out.println("Your first argument is: "+args[0]);
}
}

 
compile by > javac CommandLineExample.java
run by > java CommandLineExample sonoo
 
Output: Your first argument is: sonoo
 Example of command-line argument that prints all the values In this example, we are printing all the arguments passed from the command-line. For this purpose, we have traversed the array using for loop. 
class A{
public static void main(String args[]){

for(int i=0;i<args.length;i++)
System.out.println(args[i]);

}
}
 
compile by > javac A.java
run by > java A sonoo jaiswal 1 3 abc
 
Output: sonoo
       jaiswal
       1
       3
       abc
